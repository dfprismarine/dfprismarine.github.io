# **Example**

The code relies on you stacking methods on your CodeLine object. Here is an example that roughly covers everything. [You can click me to skip to the actual documentation.](#documentation)
```js
const joins = new Variable("joins", "saved");
new CodeLine('event', 'Join')
.setVar("+=", joins)
.playerAction("SendMessage", joins, "People have joined this game so far!")
.ifVar(">=", joins, 100, line => { // an if variable, with 2 chest paramaters (the joins variable, and a number)
    line // Start stacking methods on the object again
    .playerAction("SendMessage", "That means more than 100 users have joined!");
}).build(); // Important to finish your code
```

It is also important to note that this is not the **required** behavior. Although convenient, you do **not have** to stack methods like this, you could do something like follows.
```js
const line = new CodeLine("event", "Join");
line.playerAction("Hello =)");

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) line.playerAction("SendMessage", "There are now 10 blocks with this action and message!");

line.build();
```

# **IMPORTANT**
### **CodeLine**
The codeline is the main object that keeps track of all of the blocks you have setup. This is what your code should ideally start with. **This is required to make your code.** You should keep in mind that when you are done with your codeline, you can finish it using the [build()](#build) method.

**Constructor**
```js
new CodeLine(blockType, eventName)
```

- blockType - The type of block being placed, **`event` = Player Event, `entity_event` = Entity Event**
- eventname - The name of the event you are looking for.

Like said above, blockType accepts either **event**, or **entity_event** right now. It does not support process/functions. If you want to make a function, use a codeblock and replace the beginning block once its in-game.

**Example**
```js
new CodeLine("event", "Join") // a new codeline, starting with the Player Event JOIN.
.playerAction("SendMessage", "hi %default!")
.playerAction("EnableFlight")
.build(); // it is VERY important that your code finishes with a CodeLine build() method.
```

### **Actions/Setvar**
All block actions/setvar are setup the same way. They all work using the `action type`, and then the chest paramaters. You can use `playerEvent`, `gameEvent`, and `setVar`.

**Usage**
```js
<CodeLine>.playerAction("SendMessage", "Hello there!", "This supports numbers aswell", 22, 19);

<CodeLine>.gameAction("CancelEvent");

// You can also use all DF variable items as items inside of the paramaters.
const joins = new Variable("joins", "saved");

<codeline>.setVar("+=", joins)
.playerAction("SendMessage", "Hello %default! You joined at position" + joins);

```


# **Variable Items**
### **Number/Text**
Number / Text Numbers and Text variables are automatically parsed from normal strings/numbers.
In a situation where you need to create an advanced Number, use the _Num_ constructor. 

**more info/support for Num soon**
##
### **Variable**

Represents a diamond fire variable item. Can be constructed by using the new keyword.

 **Constructor** **optional*
 ```js
 new Variable(name, *type);
 ```

 - name - The variables item name.
 - *type** - Type of variable (default: "unsaved") (unsaved, saved, local)
 
Variables have 3 states. "saved", "unsaved", and "local". If none is given, it will default to "unsaved", like it does in the server.
##

### **Location**
 Represents a location in game. Can be constructed using the new keyword. 
 
 **Constructor** **optional*
  ```js
new Location(*x, *y, *z, *pitch, *yaw)
  ```
  
  Locations are relevant to plot location. Meaning (0, 0) is the corner of your plot. 
  
  Example:

```js
const loc = new Location(45.5, 0, 22.5);
new CodeLine("event", "Join")
.playerAction("Teleport", loc)
.build();
```
##
### **Particle**
 Represents a particle item in game. Can be constructed using the "new" keyword. 
 
 **Constructor**
```js
new Particle(type);
```

 - type - The particle effect.

 Additional content may come in the future. 

Example:

```js
new CodeLine("event", "Join")
.playerAction("GiveItem", new Particle("Cloud"))
.build();
```
##
### **Potion**

Represents a potion item. Can be constructed using the "new" keyword.

**Constructor** **optional*
```js
new Potion(effect, length, *amplifier)
```
 - effect - The potion effect name,
 - length - The length of the potion effect (in ticks),
 - *amplifier** - The potion amplifier (default: 1).

Amplifier is optional. For a full list of effects, look at the wiki, or use DFVisual or something.

Example:
```js
const pot = new Potion("Strength", 60, 2);
new CodeLine("Event", "Jump")
.playerAction("GiveEffect", pot)
.build();
```
##
### **Sound**
Represents a sound item. Can be constructed using the "new" keyword.

 **Constructor** **optional*
 ```js
new Sound(noise, *pitch, *yaw);
  ```
 - noise - The sound that is represented,
 - *pitch** - The pitch the sound is at (default: 1.0)
 - *vol** - The volume the sound is at (default: 1.0)
 Pitch and volume are both optional parameters. Neither are required.
 
 Example:
```js
new CodeLine("event", "Join")
.playerEvent("PlaySound", new Sound("Pling"))
.playerEvent("SendMessage", "%default has joined!")
.target("All Players")
.build();
```
##
##
### **Value**
Represents a Game Value item. Can be constructed using the "new" keyword.
**NOTE: Both GameValue and Value are acceptable constructors.**

 **Constructor** **optional*
 ```js
new GameValue(value, *target);
  ```
 - value - The game value name
 - *target** - The target [killer, etc] (default: default)
 Example:
```js
new CodeLine("event", "Join")
.setVar("=", new Variable("Example"), new Value("Server TPS"))
.build();
```
##

# IF blocks / Repeat
### **IF**
Supports the following `ifPlayer`, `ifEntity`, `ifGame`, and `ifVar`. These work the same as the [repeat](#repeat). The final paramter to the If block must be a function. The function will automatically be executed and the code inside of it. If there is no function in the end, your code will error.

```js
ifGame(action, item*, item*, etc*, FUNC => {});
```

- action - The type of IF, for example, for `ifPlayer` you might want to use `isSprinting`
- item/etc - Items, Variables, whatever you want.
- FUNC - This one is very important. This is a function that will be called when the if is registered.

To learn more about arrow functions, [here's the MDN documentation on it.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). **It is also important to note that you can stack as many ifs inside of eachother as you'd like.**

**Example**
```js
new CodeLine("event" "Jump")
.ifPlayer("IsSprinting", param => {
  param // Start stacking methods on the object again
  .playerAction("SendMessage", "This is inside of the if.");
})
.playerAction("SendMessage", "This is outside of the if")
.build();
```
### **Repeat** 

Works the same as IFs. Will return the codeline object to continue stacking methods. 

```js
repeat(action, item, item, line => {});` 
```

 - action - String action (Adjacent, Foreber, Multiple, Grid, While, Range, ForEach),
 - item - Items that will be placed in the chest *(not an array, place as many as you want)*,
 - line - A function that is called. The function is called with the object your stacking method is on.

 Example:

```js
new CodeLine("event", "Join")
.repeat("Multiple", 20, line => {
    line.playerAction("SendMessage", "Hello");
}).build();
```


##
### Misc
## Num
**Note: Numbers will automatically be made into a number variable, you should only use this for more advanced uses such as needing to use %math or %var**

Numbers can be constructed simply by using the Num constructor.

`new Num(value)`
- value *the value of the number variable.
##
## build
build is a very important method. It is called once you are done with your codeline to mark it as completed. Your code **WILL** error if you do not finish it with a `.build()`.

**Example**
```js
new CodeLine('event', 'Join')
.playerAction("SendMessage", "You joined a game, yay")
.build();
```

Notice how the build is called. This is very important, without the build method at the end, your code will not read correctly.
##
## target
The target method sets the most recent codeblocks target. It is used to target a specific group of players.

**Example**
```js
<CodeLine>
.playerAction("SendMessage", "This message will be sent to everyone!")
.target("All Players")
```
##
## Tags
Tags are automatically added when needed. They are fetched from a seperate page and then are automatically added to blocks that have tags. If the connection to get tag data fails, it will simply ignore tags, and you can fix them.. or something.

**tags are automatically added when needed. There is not currently a way to modify them with this.**
